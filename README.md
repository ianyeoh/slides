# 🛝 Slides

A presentation tool available as a web application, written in React.js as a personal frontend web development learning exercise. See it in action [here](https://slides.ianyeoh.com). 
If prompted to register, feel free to enter a junk email (they aren't validated or used outside of an authentication context). Persisted data in the backend database is wiped periodically daily.

## Notes

- This was written as a demo application (don't use in production).
- The backend was written as a simple, alternative method of persisting the frontend's application data as JSON. In a real setting, a REST API would be preferred.
